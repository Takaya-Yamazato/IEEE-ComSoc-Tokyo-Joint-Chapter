# Title: Internet4All through “Internet Lite” for Connect the Unconnected: The Killer App for 5G and Beyond

### Abstract:

Connecting the Unconnected or under-connected (CTU) is the holy grail of transforming the lives of over 3 billion people around the globe with wireless internet who are yet to experience its value in multiple ways. If this could be accomplished, its impact on the society would be enormous as everyone would have access to information and an opportunity to improve their quality of life and income.

This talk endeavors to highlight the need to consider the CTU requirements in 5G and B5G networks to enable affordable solutions. Use of renewable energy sources will enable deployment in remote areas where there is a lack of power grid, or it is intermittent. Thus, this talk identifies a number of technology gaps to be filled in by 5G and B5G networks, such that access is affordable and content and services are actually consumed by the targeted set of users. Although hitherto unexplored, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have a tremendous role to play for serving the rural and remote communities both to deliver the most needed services and to customize them to the digital capacity of the end users. Technology aside, the need to develop innovative business models is a must to be commercially sustainable in the long-term. A number of such models, especially designed for the rural population, are proposed, such as Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE) Freemium (Free + Premium), revenue sharing among the chain of service providers, subsidized billing by USOF (Universal Service Obligation Funds). Finally, we provide an overview of the IEEE Future Networks Technical Community work on CTU in the CTU working group.
