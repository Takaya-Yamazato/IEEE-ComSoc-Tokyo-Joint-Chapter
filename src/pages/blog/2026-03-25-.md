## DLT at Keio University


# Title: Exploring Generative AI for Future Wireless Communications

- Date and time: March 25, 10:30-11:30
- Location: Discussion room 9 (14-219), Keio University - Faculty of Science and Technology, Tokyo, Japan
- Speaker: Prof. Zhi Ding, University of California, Davis


### Abstract:
The recent wave of progress in generative artificial intelligence (AI)
has stimulated numerous novel concepts and achieved phenomenal success
in modern applications, including ChatGPT. Beyond its critical role in
content generation for computer vision and natural language processing,
generative AI presents profound opportunities and unlimited potential in
wireless communications and networking. In this talk, we systematically
address the tremendous potential and opportunities presented by the
emergence and integration of generative AI in high-efficiency and
contextual communication networks. We present a transformative design of
a future go-oriented contextual communication framework enabled by
generative models of stable diffusion. Specifically, we deliver clear
design and implementation steps, analyze properties and performances,
and expand on potential future extensions
