# Title: Introduction to the Quantum Internet with a communication engineering perspective


### Speaker: Prof. Angela Sara Cacciapuoti and Prof. Marcello Caleffi

### Abstract:
Internet turned 50: five decades that shaped the world we live in. Indeed, Internet itself evolved astonishingly since the beginning, from a network prototype consisting of a few static nodes in the early days to a leviathan interconnecting with billions of devices half of the world’s population. But what comes next, the so-called Quantum Internet, will be even more revolutionary, likely in ways we cannot image yet. The aim of this talk is to highlight the challenges and the opportunities connected to the design and deployment of the Quantum Internet, which requires a major network-paradigm shift and a multidisciplinary effort to harness the counter-intuitive peculiarities of quantum mechanics.
